            <h2>My interests are as vast as the universe</h2>
            <p>
                Currently I am playing games: Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero, Reverse: 1999, and Wuthering Waves.
                Among those games, I'm just a casual player in terms of its story and character development (builds and kinda thingy), except Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail.
                I quite follow the META shift, team building, character's kit, and the stories in Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail.
                Please note that I merely follow them not in 'hard' way.

                My favorites characters from the games will be listed below:
                1) Genshin Impact: Alhaitham, Eula, Furina. ps. I'm a full-time Furina's defender.
                2) Honkai: Star Rail: Dan Heng 4 star, Dr. Ratio, Jade, Ruan Mei, Topaz.
                3) Zenless Zone Zero: Billy, Ellen, Lighter, Necomata, Nicole.
                4) Reverse: 1999: X.
                5) Wuthering Waves: Camellya, Xiangli Yao.

                I also LOVE LOVE LOVE Taylor Swift. I am a big fan of her!
                1989 is my favorite album. If you listen to her also, let's have a listening party, no?

                but I don't mind following your immaculate taste too at all!
